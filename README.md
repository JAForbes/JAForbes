### Hi! ðŸ‘¾

I'm James,

I'm a generalist software developer interested in full stack app architectures.

I'm currently working on a query language for UI state management, and trying to understand datalog a bit better.

Recently I [rewrote S.js as a clean room implementation](https://github.com/JAForbes/S) to try to understand it better.  

I help run [Harth Systems](https://harth.io/) where I work on [Odin](https://harth.io/odin/) and a few other software projects.  I'm also currently contracting at an Australian Bank which is lots of fun and very interesting.

I used to participate in [game](https://canyon.itch.io/space-to-proceed) [jams](https://canyon.itch.io/provider) but I haven't done that for a long time, still I find game jams have been great for learning how to scope and finish projects, so I recommend it!

You'll probably see me around the internet advocating for mithril.js, functional programming, reactive programming and postgres.

I'm always up for a chat, so hit me up and ask me anything!

If you like, you can follow me on [cohost](https://cohost.org/jmsfbs-code).  I also infrequently update my website https://james-forbes.com.
