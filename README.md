### Hey! ‚≠ê

I'm James,

I'm a generalist software developer interested in full stack app architectures.

I'm currently working on methodologies to make client side SQL safe and secure.  And trying to understand S.js by [rewriting it](https://github.com/JAForbes/S) iteratively.

Check out this post on Streams being an all round better abstraction than React's Hooks: https://james-forbes.com/#!/posts/hooks-and-streams

I help run [Harth Systems](https://harth.io/) where I work on [Odin](https://harth.io/odin/) and a few other software projects.  I'm also currently contracting at an Australian Bank which is lots of fun and very interesting.

I used to participate in [game](https://canyon.itch.io/space-to-proceed) [jams](https://canyon.itch.io/provider) but I haven't done that for a long time, still I find game jams have been great for learning how to scope and finish projects, so I recommend it!

You'll probably see me around the internet advocating for mithril.js, functional programming, reactive programming and postgres.

I'm always up for a chat, so hit me up and ask me anything!
