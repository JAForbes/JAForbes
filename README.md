### Hey! ⭐

I'm James,

I'm a generalist software developer interested in full stack app architectures.

I’m currently working on a relational/reactive JS state management system.  But I also write a bit about functional programming, ops and deployment, application architecture and whatever else is interesting me technically.

Check out this recent post on Streams being an all round better abstraction than React's Hooks: https://james-forbes.com/#!/posts/hooks-and-streams

I have my own business [Harth Systems](https://harth.io/) where I work on [Odin](https://harth.io/odin/) and a few other software projects.  I also occasionally consult on a short term basis.

You'll probably see me around the internet advocating for mithril.js, functional programming and/or postgres.

I've been on a bit of hiatus dogfooding some technology that I hope to open source as soon as possible.

I'm always up for a chat, so hit me up and ask me anything!
