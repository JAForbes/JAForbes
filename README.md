### Hi! ü§ñ

I'm James,

I'm a generalist software developer interested in full stack app architectures.

I'm currently working on a query language for UI state management, and trying to understand datalog a bit better.

I recently rewrote a typed / structured router for web apps [check it out](https://github.com/JAForbes/superouter)

I help run [Harth Systems](https://harth.io/).  

- We maintain our own construction project management app [Odin](https://odin.harth.io/odin)
- Build new products as partnerships 
- And we do ad-hoc consulting too (postgres, web services, web apps)

I used to participate in [game](https://canyon.itch.io/space-to-proceed) [jams](https://canyon.itch.io/provider) but I haven't done that for a long time, still I find game jams have been great for learning how to scope and finish projects, so I'd like to get back into that eventually.

I'm always up for a chat, so hit me up and ask me anything!
